- **Registration Eligibility:** The competition is open to all. Participants may form teams of any size, but each individual may join only one team. Team members must self-certify that they are not part of multiple submissions; violations will result in the disqualification of all involved teams.

- **Permitted methods and resource limits:** During the development phase, participants are free to use any approach and computational resource. In the test phase, however, solutions are expected to emphasize parameter-space analysis and must complete evaluation within 24 hours on a single Nvidia A100 GPU. This constraint promotes practical, lightweight methods.

- **Submission limits:** Each team may submit up to three entries per day per track during the development phase. In the test phase, each team is allowed a maximum of five submissions per track for final evaluation.

- **Finalist obligations:** The top three teams will be required to submit their code and a detailed report describing their methodology. Finalists will also be invited to present their solutions at the official competition session.
